      <li><b>Why is visualization effective?</b></li>
        <ul>
          <li>Numbers are meaningless without context, and humans have a highly developed sense of vision. When given some numerical
          relation, we have to relate it to something we know for it to make sense. For example, if I'm told that the President has a
          55% approval rating, my primary association is "Oh, that's a bit more than half," because I know what a half is.
          Visualizations skip the middle step. They are able to take numbers and display them in a form that a human can instantly
          interpret by pattern recognition and comparison. Without a visualization, finding patterns from numbers is more difficult,
          and we're more likely to make errors or draw inaccurate conclusions.</li>
        </ul>
      <li><b>What are the more effective ways to encode data for perceptual tasks?</b></li>
        <ul>
          <li>This depends upon what kinds of data you have, and what message you are trying to convey to the viewer. If the goal is
          to present data in a way such that they are easily comparable, the <b>hierarchy of elementary perceptual tasks</b>
          ranks the most effective methods for doing so. However, if we want to present data such that the viewer can notice
          general patterns, we can use something like a data map to sacrifice comparability for the sake of easy pattern recognition.</li>
        </ul>
      <li><b>What are trade-offs that Cairo asks us to consider when building a visualization?</b></li>
        <ul>
          <li>There are multiple tradeoffs that Cairo wants us to consider. As previously mentioned, there is often a tension between
              displaying exact data such that they can be easily compared, and displaying approximate data such that general patterns
              may be noticed. In addition, when there are multiple things to compare within a given data set, we often have to choose
              one or two comparisons per visualization. We can make many visualizations for each comparison, but this starts to become
              overwhelming to the viewer at first glance. Lastly, each type of visualization has its own unique tradeoffs, which should
              be considered by the designer.</li>
